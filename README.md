# MY-FIRST-PYTHON-GAME
 ROCK , PAPER , SCISSOR!
 
You may have played rock paper scissors in your small age.If you’re unfamiliar, rock paper scissors is a hand game for two or more players. Participants say “rock, paper, scissors” and then simultaneously form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended). 

The rules are straightforward:

# Rock smashes scissors.
# Paper covers rock.
# Scissors cut paper.

Now that you have the rules down, you can start thinking about how they might translate to Python code.
